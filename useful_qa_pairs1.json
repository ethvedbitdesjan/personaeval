      "question": "\nTaking the long view now, what was the image of the computer in the mid 196Os or whenever you first saw one? And where are we now? What was the \u2013 how did the PC enact that change?",
      "answer": "\nI first saw my first computer when I was twelve. I saw my first computer when I was twelve. And it was at NASA. We had a local NASA center nearby. And it was a terminal, which was connected to a big computer somewhere and I got a timesharing account on it. And I was fascinated by this thing. And I saw my second computer a few years later which was really the first desktop computer ever made. It was made by Hewlett Packard. It was called the 9100-A. And it ran a language called BASIC. And it was very large. It had a very small cathode ray tube on it for display. And I got a chance to play with one of those maybe in 1968 or \u201869. And spent every spare moment I had trying to write programs for it. I was so fascinated by this. And so I was probably fairly lucky. And then my introduction to computers very rapidly moved from a terminal to within maybe twelve months or so, actually seeing one of the first, probably the first desktop computer ever\u2026ever really produced. And so my point of view never really changed from being able to get my arms around it even though my arms probably didn\u2019t quite fit around that first one."

      "question": "\nHow did the PC change the world?",
      "answer": "\nWell, though the analogy is nowhere perfect and certainly one needs to factor out the environmental concerns of the analogy as well. There is a lot to be said for comparing it to going from trains, from passenger trains to automobiles. And the advent of the automobile gave us a personal freedom of transportation. In the same way the advent of the computer gave us the ability to start to use computers without having to convince other people that we needed to use computers. And the biggest effect of the personal computer revolution has been to allow millions and millions of people to experience computers themselves decades before they ever would have in the old paradigm. And to allow them to participate in the making of choices and controlling their own destiny using these tools.\n\nBut it has created problems. And the largest problems are that now that we have all these very powerful tools, we\u2019re still islands and we\u2019re still not really connecting these people using these powerful tools together. And that\u2019s really been the challenge of the last few years and the next several years is how to connect these things back together so that we can rebuild a fabric of these things rather than just individual points f light if you will. And get the benefit of both, the passenger train and the automobile."

      "question": "\nWhat\u2019s the vision behind NeXT?",
      "answer": "\nIt\u2019s not so much different than everything I\u2019ve ever done in my life with computers starting with the Apple II and the Macintosh, and now NeXT which is if you believe that these are the most incredible tools we\u2019ve ever built which I do, then the more powerful tool we can give to people, the more they can do with it. And in this case we found a way to do two or three things that were real breakthroughs.\n\nNumber one was to put a much more powerful computer in front of people for about the same price as a PC. The second was to integrate that networking into the computer so we can begin to make this NeXT revolution within a personal computing. And the PCs so far have not been able to do that very well. And the third thing, and maybe the most important was to create a whole new software architecture from the ground up that lets us build these new types of applications and lets them, lets us build them in 25 percent of the time that it normally takes to do on a PC. So we spent four years with 50 to a hundred of the best software people that I know creating a whole new software platform from the ground up. And the way our industry works is that you create this platform software first and then you go out and you get people to write new applications on top of it. Well the height that these new applications can soar is\u2026is enabled or limited by the 8platform software. And there\u2019s only been three systems that have ever been successful in the whole history of desktop computing and that was the Apple IIs platform software of which there wasn\u2019t too much. The IBM PC and Macintosh. So we\u2019re attempting to create the fourth platform software standard and hopefully we\u2019ll succeed because it will allow these applications to be written which far far exceed in capacity what can be done in today\u2019s machines.\n\nInterviewer:\nWhat happens when you have a network that allows the relative minorities in a whole different area come together. How does that change the democracy?\nSJ:\nI don\u2019t know. But what I have seen is I\u2019ve seen interpersonal computing happening at our own company. Or maybe the best way to put it is, I remember when the first spreadsheet came out. I saw it fly through Apple as well as other companies. And when we invented desktop publishing of course it influenced Apple first. And I\u2019ve seen the same thing happen with interpersonal computing here at NeXT. We decided to put a NeXT machine on every employee\u2019s desktop about 18 months ago and connect them with the very high-speed networking that\u2019s built in. And I\u2019ve seen the revolution here with my own eyes. And it\u2019s actually larger than the first two. Let me give you some examples.\n\nIf we want to \u2014 if we\u2019re going to be doing a special project let\u2019s say with a company, and we \u2014 and let\u2019s say the company is called, what\u2019s your\u2026WGBH. We\u2019re going to be doing a special project with WGBH. And what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll create a special mailbox, WGBH and we\u2019ll put twenty people on it that are going to be helping on this project. Now these twenty people will be from all over our company, from marketing, from sales, from engineering, some from manufacturing. Maybe some from our Boston office so they can be close by. And if one sends a message to this mailbox, they\u2019ll all get it like that, instantly. And if one sends a reply they\u2019ll copy the whole mailbox so the rest of the team members get to read the intellectual content going back and forth. And everyone on this, in this mailbox will probably get around 30 mail messages a day. And they\u2019ll spend about twenty minutes, thirty minutes reading these and answering these per day. And it will be like a beehive.\n\nNow this project is very important for our company and I want to make sure it\u2019s getting off right. So I\u2019ll put my own name on this mailbox and I\u2019ll see these thirty mail messages fly by. All of the disagreements and the arguments and the thoughts and the decisions. And I can just let it fly by and read it. I can do some background coaching with a few people if I think they\u2019re a little off track. I can get right on the network and kibbutz if I\u2019d like. And after a month or so when I know that it\u2019s going well I can take my name off. And so not only is this a way to organize violating all management and geographic boundaries, it\u2019s also a way to manage where one can see. Again the thoughts, disagreements and decisions of a company fly by a manager in a way that they never could before. And we have seen it reduce the number of meetings we have at least by fifty percent. We\u2019ve seen it get far more managers and individual contributors involved in decisions than there ever were before. We think the quality of the decisions is a lot higher. And we\u2019ve seen a window for management to look into the process of this organism we call our company in a way that has never before been possible. As we become part of this electronically community that\u2019s going to provide us wonderful new capabilities and communications abilities. But we still always want to be able to disconnect that network spigot, take it off, and take our standalone computer somewhere, let\u2019s say home.\n\nNow what\u2019s going to happen rapidly as with radio links and with fiber optics to the home, you\u2019re going to be able to hook your computer up to your network at home. But there\u2019s always going to be that cabin in the middle of nowhere that I want to go for a two week vacation where I want my computer. And if it doesn\u2019t work in a completely standalone way, I\u2019m going to be not happy. So we have to provide a fluid way for these things to kind of dock into the mother load network, but also undock and allow me as an individual to carry my computer up into Yosemite backpacking. And where there\u2019s no radio links and no fiber optic links and still be able to use it and then come back and dock back into the network and find out what happened when I left and share some of my thoughts maybe with some other folks. So we\u2019re working on that. That\u2019s our goal for the next five years is that seamless transition between a standalone computer and the computer as part of this network community.\nInterviewer:\nIt also keeps away the welling aspects of always being hooked into the network.\nSJ:\nThat\u2019s right. I actually think what \u2013 an interesting paradox is the network which is ultimately going to define and create the home computer market. Not keeping our recipes on these things or something like we thought in 1975. Being a part of that network and not being able to stay away from it while you\u2019re home will drive people to get computers in every house just like we have a telephone in every house.\nInterviewer:\nBut computers then won\u2019t be just computers. They\u2019ll be radios, and stereos, and TVs.\nSJ:\nNo I think, I think they\u2019ll be just computers. Just like your phone isn\u2019t your television set. Just like your toaster isn\u2019t your radio. I think they\u2019ll be computers and they\u2019ll have many of the capabilities of these other devices. Multimedia, the ability to integrate sound and video in with the computer is absolutely coming. But a lot of people have mistaken it as the end rather than the means. We see multimedia as more of a means. In other words, people aren\u2019t going to buy a computer for multimedia. They\u2019re going to buy it for training. Or they\u2019re going to buy it for interpersonal communication. And in that communication, in addition to a text, they\u2019re going to want voice. They\u2019re going to want, potentially I might want to send you a video clip. But the real market is to help us communicate better, or to help us train somebody. And we need to not lose sight of that.\nInterviewer:\nI want to get your thoughts on the user interface stuff. And I\u2019d like to look at the transition \u2013 Xerox to Apple. When did you hear, what was the image of Xerox PARC and what was it like when you first went in there?\nSJ:\nWell Xerox PARC was a research lab set up by Xerox when they were making a lot of profits in copier days. And they were doing some computer science research which was basically an extension of some stuff started by a guy named Doug Engelbart when he was at SRI. Doug had invented the mouse, and invented the Bitmap display. And some Xerox folks that\u2026that Xerox I believe hired away from Doug or split off from Doug somehow and got to Xerox, were continuing along in this vein. And I first went over there in 1979 and I saw what they were doing with the larger screens, proportionately spaced texts and the mouse. And it was just instantly obvious to anyone that this was the way things should be. And so I remember coming back to Apple thinking our\u2026our future has just changed. This is where we have to go.\n\nThe problem was that Xerox had never made a commercial computer. This group of people at Xerox was\u2026was was more concerned with looking out fifteen years than they were looking out fifteen months trying to make a product that somebody could use. So there were a lot of issues that they hadn\u2019t solved like menus, other things like that. And at Apple what we had to do was to do two things. One was complete the research which really was only about fifty percent complete. And the second was to find a way to implement it at a low enough cost where people would buy it. And that was really our challenge.\nInterviewer:\nWhat did you succeed in doing with the Mac?\nSJ:\nWell the Macintosh as you remember when it came out, we called it the computer for the rest of us. And what that meant was that while experts could use some of the computers that were already out, most people didn\u2019t 4want \u2014 again the computer was not an end in itself. It was a means to an end. And so most people didn\u2019t want to learn how to use the computer. They just wanted to use it. And the Macintosh was supposed to be the computer for people that just wanted to use a computer without having to learn how to use one, spend six months.\n\nNow it turned out that the paradox was that to make a computer easier to use you needed a more powerful computer in the first place because you were going to burn a lot of the cycles on making it easy to use. And so this computer that was easy to use was actually more powerful and could do more things than the less easy to use computer. And it took people a few years to figure that out about the Macintosh. But I think people did.\nInterviewer:\nActually there\u2019s a funny joke that we were clowning around one day and one of our group is an IBM person. And so he was saying, some little girl walks up and sees a prompt and goes to her daddy and says \u201cit\u2019s broken\u201d. Where\u2019s my desktop? Where\u2019s\u2026where\u2019s my metaphor. And we\u2019ve gotten, we\u2019ve\u2026we\u2019ve adopted this new metaphor. How has that changed the look of computers?\nSJ:\nWell I think, I think the Macintosh was created by a group of people who felt that there wasn\u2019t a strict division between sort of science and art. Or in other words, that mathematics is really a liberal art if you look at it from a slightly different point of view. And why can\u2019t we interject typography into computers? Why can\u2019t we have computers talking to us in English language? And looking back, five years later, this seems like a trivial observation. But at the time it was cataclysmic in its consequences. And the battles that were fought to push this point of view out the door were very large.\nInterviewer:\nThe balance between thinking and doing. I mean one of the things in the semiconductors was you had risktakers. Bob Noyce learns to hang- glide at age 40. These people like laying their butts on the line. How important was that in the early days? I mean we\u2019re going back to \u201975.\nSJ:\nWell again after seeing\u2026 my entire life has been spent only in one industry which is this one. And but I\u2019ve been in it now for about fifteen years and I\u2019ve seen a lot of people make a lot of things. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people fail a lot of things. And my point of view on this, or my observation is that the doers are the major thinkers. The people that really create the things that change this industry are both the thinker and doer in one person. And if we really go back and we examine, you know did Leonardo have a guy off to the side that was thinking five years out in the future what he would paint or the technology he would use to paint it, of course not. Leonardo was the artist but he also mixed all his own paints. He also was a fairly good chemist. He knew about pigments, knew about human anatomy. And combing all of those skills together, the art and the science, the thinking and the doing, was what resulted in the exceptional result. And there is no difference in our industry. The people that have really made the contributions have been the thinkers and the doers.\n\nAnd when you \u2013 a lot of people of course, it\u2019s very easy to take credit for the thinking. The doing is more concrete. But somebody, it\u2019s very easy to say I thought of this three years ago. But usually when you dig a little deeper, you find that the people that really did it were also the people that really worked through the hard intellectual problems as well.\nInterviewer:\nWhat\u2019s it going to take to make computers accessible to the rest of the public? And I don\u2019t know what the statistics are but 20 million people on computers or \u2026. What\u2019s it going to take to get it to a hundred million?\nSJ:\nWell probably death is the best invention of life. Because it means there\u2019s a constant turnover. And so if you want to make a change in our society, the best place to do it is in the educational system. So that you\u2019re \u2014 there are, there are now generations of people that have come out of school who computers are second nature to them. And the people in our society that\u2026that at this point still have, have not embraced these things are getting older, has that cycle, that wheel of birth and death turns, just like driving, people that don\u2019t drive are very rare. Another generation or two, people don\u2019t use computers are, will be pretty rare. It\u2019s a harsh way of saying it but\u2026\nInterviewer:\nIt\u2019s very true. I mean there is a line that says those people that don\u2019t adopt it will die off. Focusing now on the third program where we\u2019ve gone from semiconductors and the vision is that IBM is this big machine, UNIVAC, big large machine. And we take the line through an integrated circuit microprocessor. And I actually got some great stuff from Ted Hoff about, you know, it\u2019s a lightbulb. It burns out, you replace it. Then we lead up into the beginnings of the personal computer. So what were you doing at the time and how did that get started?\nSJ:\nActually you know, it wasn\u2019t Intel that first figured out that the microprocessor was a computer. They designed these things to be used in calculators. And they thought, the reason that the microprocessor came about was they thought if they could design a slightly programmable one, the next customer that walked in the door that wanted a slightly different calculator they could just spend a few months rather than a few years designing a new piece of silicone. But I think the thought of making a computer never really occurred to them. And it was the hobbyists that thought about making a computer out of these things. It was the computer hobbyists community that first did that.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think Intel quite understood that for a few years. But again the first thing that happened was these people came together and formed a club, the home group computer club at Stanford was the first one in the country. And it was a beehive of all of these people who were interested in these small little computers. People that might have been ham radio operators, people that might have you know worked with large computers were all gathered together to share, discuss their latest little projects. It was very exciting. And there was not a month that would go by where some breakthrough didn\u2019t happen. And then the first magazine came along which was Byte magazine to communicate on a national scale with all these hobbyists. So that it was a very, very exciting dynamic time.\nInterviewer:\nWhat did you think when you saw the Apple I? Yeah when you first saw that Woz was building that board.\nSJ:\nWell it didn\u2019t quite work that way actually. What happened was that Woz and I had known each other since I was about 12 or l3 years old. And we built, our first project together was we built these little blue boxes to make free telephone calls. And we had the best blue box in the world. It was this all digital blue box. I don\u2019t think it works anymore. But we had, we had a fun time doing that. So when it came to building a computer together Woz focused mostly, Woz was the brilliant hardware engineer and focused on the core design of the computer. And I was worrying about which parts we ought to use and how we were going to build these things and how it sort of, and somebody that wasn\u2019t a Woz was going to manage to buy all the extra parts you still needed to buy and plug this thing together because you still needed to buy your own keyboard, your own display, and your own power supply. And so you needed to be pretty much of a hardware hobbyist.\n\nNow we made the, a very important decision was to not offer our computers a kit. Even though you needed to buy these extra parts. The main computer board itself came fully assembled. We were the first company in the world to do that. Everybody else was offering their little computers a kit. And what that meant was was there was maybe an order of magnitude of more people who could actually buy our computer and use it than if they had to build it themselves. And the Apple II was actually the first computer to come fully assembled where you didn\u2019t have to do anything. And the reason there was it was our observation that for every hardware hobbyist, someone who could either build the kit themselves or at least find these five or ten extra parts they needed, there were a thousand potential software hobbyists. And if they didn\u2019t have to do anything with the hardware except use it, make\u2026 that meant write their own programs. Still there was a much larger group of people that could take advantage of this. So we wanted to reach them. That was the real breakthrough of the Apple II.\nInterviewer:\nContrast if you will the Atlantic City fair with the West Coast computer firm.\nSJ:\nWell the Atlantic City computer show was the first\u2026 the first face to face gathering of personal computer hobbyists from all around the country was the show put on in Atlantic City in 1976. And it was in the basement of some dingy hotel. And it just happened to be about 300 degrees outside. So the basement, it was like a steambath. And it was impossible to be down there for longer than a half an hour without being completely drenched. And nevertheless there were a few hundred hobbyists completely drenched walking around for hours. And we had a little tiny booth there. There was a table tablecloth over a hotel table. And there were, Woz and I and a friend or two of our went there and we had our few Apple ls there and a little poster we made. And that was really our first computer show in the world.\n\nA year later, I think maybe even nine months later, there was the first West coast computer fair which was a much more professional operation by, in comparison with Atlantic City. But still very every hobby oriented compared with what goes on today. And that was in San Francisco and there were maybe a hundred companies showing their wares. And it was attended by maybe a thousand people which was a lot for our industry at that time. l3,000, wow, really. 13,000 people. That\u2019s a lot.\nInterviewer:\nJim Warren told me that.\nSJ:\nThat\u2019s a lot. I\u2026I\u2019d be surprised at that. But maybe he knows better than I do. 6,000. Thousands of people. And that\u2019s when we introduced the Apple II. And I think the Apple II is probably the hit of the show at that time.\nInterviewer:\nIn between you went and found McKenna and Markkulla?\nSJ:\nWell we found Regis by \u2014 I used to like Intel\u2019s advertising. So I called him up one day and I said who does your advertising? And he said Regis McKenna. And I said what\u2019s Regis McKenna? He said no it\u2019s a person. He gave me his phone number and I called Regis up. He told us to go away about four or five times, but eventually he agreed to help us out. And then Mike Markkulla I found from a venture capitalist actually, told me that I should go talk to Mike Markkula. Now we hooked up with Mike just around the time we introduced the Apple II. Maybe a month before. But the Apple II was pretty much designed and ready to go. And then Mike came on board and things really started to take off.\nInterviewer:\nHow important was the disk drive in the development of Apple?\nSJ:\nDisk drive was crucial. One of the things that people forget when they think about\u2026about Apple and the Apple II in particular was that we were the first company to come out with a reliable, inexpensive floppy disk drive. And we had a low cost floppy disk drive that really worked about two to three years before any of our competitors. And that was an incredibly important reason why the Apple II was successful. A matter of fact, there were a few others. The Apple II could hold up to 48 kilobytes of memory which today doesn\u2019t seem like much, but at that time was maybe three times as much as its competitors. And that\u2019s why Visicalc was written for the Apple II. It was the only computer that could hold it. And so if Visicalc had been written for some other computer you\u2019d be interviewing somebody else right now. And it was because of that design decision and other design decisions like it that the Apple II really beat its competition.\nInterviewer:\nHow did the Apple II change the world of computing?\nSJ:\nWell the Apple II was the world\u2019s first successful personal computer. And really defined the personal computer as we know it today. So I think it changed the world a lot from that point of view.\nInterviewer:\nOne of the theses is that\u2026. well let me turn this question around. How important is market research? How much did you rely on it in the early days?\nSJ:\nWell I think in the early days it was very easy because you would go to a home group computer club meeting and there was your whole market and so you could find out what they thought. Now if you show them your product and see what they thought and you could because products were much simpler then and within a few months you could change it all around and come back and show the new one.\n\nBut as the market got more sophisticated it was less easy to do that. And the problem is that market research can tell you what your customers think of something you show them. Or it can tell you what your customers want as an incremental improvement on what you have but very rarely can your customers predict something that they don\u2019t even quite know they want yet. As an example no market research could have led to the development of the Macintosh or the personal computer in the first place. So there are these sort of non-incremental jumps that need to take place where it\u2019s very difficult for market research to really contribute much in the early phases of thinking about how to \u2014 you know what those should be. However once you have made that jump possibly before the products on the market or even after is a great time to go check your instincts with the marketplace and verify that you\u2019re on the right track. And usually when you show people something they\u2019ll say oh my God this is fantastic. Or give you some feedback along those lines.\nInterviewer:\nHow has the personal computer changed society? I mean how have we fundamentally changed the way we do our daily business, our daily lives? How\u2019s it affected that?\nSJ:\nI\u2019m not the right person to ask. Ask Al.\nInterviewer:\nWe have just about covered, the only other thought I have is when you were getting started out, I read somewhere that you had no intention of building a company. You were just out to do stuff for yourself. Can you give me \u2013 I don\u2019t know the question asked to get that but \u2014\nSJ:\nWell, at the time we started Apple, Woz was working for Hewlett-Packard, I was working for Atari, actually for Nolan Bushnell, designing video games. And we went to Atari and showed him our early prototypes and we went to HP. And we encouraged each company to hire it the other one and let us do this for them. And we got turned down in both places, probably for good reasons. But we started the company because it was the only alternative left, not because we wanted to.\nInterviewer:\nWhen did you ever think that this was really going to happen. This was going to go from just an interesting idea that \u2026\nSJ:\nOh it didn\u2019t take very long. It happened for me when I saw people that could never possibly design a computer, could never possibly build a hardware kit. Could never possibly assemble their own keyboards and monitors. Could never even write their own software using these things, then you knew something very big was going to happen. When we got into that stage where we were high enough on the food chain if you will that a lot of people could use these things and they were really liking it.\nInterviewer:\nWhat\u2019s the goal of the NeXT factory? Why is it so automated? Why is that necessary?\nSJ:\nOne could go on for a long time about how the US has forgotten about manufacturing which has certainly been true but we\u2019re starting to wake up. And what we\u2019re finding is is that time to market is very important and quality is very important and the way we can make tremendous increase in quality and reductions in time to market is through automation. So the automation isn\u2019t there to lower the cost although it does do that, it\u2019s really there to increase the quality and decrease the time it takes us to get our new product, as an example, to market which is very important in a technology based marketplace.\n\nSo we happen to be the lowest cost producer in the world already at NeXT of our class of products. We also happen to be one of the highest quality producers of our type of product in the world. And we think for a company to survive much less prosper in the nineties that these are going to be very very important things to be world class at. We\u2019re not competing at the home group computer society anymore, we\u2019re competing with Europe Inc. and Japan Inc. and IBM Inc. and in order to do that we really have to be world class manufacturers.\nInterviewer:\nWhat if computer networks offered education?\nSJ:\nWell education been on computer networks for longer than almost anyone else. The Department of Defense has an office called DARPA and they funded a thing called ah ARPANET many many years ago to try to build a command and control network for military purposes. And they did a very brilliant thing. After they got a prototype working they gave it to the university community in America and said bang on this for awhile and see if it works and help us make it better. And after a few years of the university community doing that they created a separate version for military purposes but they left the educational version going. And that is tied together the research community of the United States now for about a decade. And it\u2019s vital to the functioning of higher education in this country.\n\nSo higher education has actually led the way. That\u2019s why we started off focusing exclusively on higher education because where else could you find five thousand people on a network but Carnegie Mellon University as an example. So higher education has been five years ahead of business in using computers in some of these powerful new ways which we\u2019re going to see now ripple into business in the first half of the nineties. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\nInterviewer:\nHow about lower education? How about school? How about lower \u2026.\nSJ:\nSo far computer used in K-12 has been primarily Apple IIs. And I wish, I wish that they\u2019d been upgrading the MacIntosh as faster than they have been but I think that\u2019s slowly happening and IBM is getting in there as well. The primary purpose of computing in K-12 has been just computer literacy and there\u2019s been a bottleneck because there hasn\u2019t been enough sophisticated courseware written and that\u2019s a problem for our society in general amongst all the other problems with our K- 12 education system. One could talk about that for a few days easily.\nInterviewer:\nGoing back to the Mac and meeting the deadline for the Mac how crazy did it get? I mean you had already said that you were going to have this big scratch at the Super Bowl.\n\nSteve Jos: Actually we wanted to get the Mac out a year before we did, so we had internal deadlines that we were not able to meet but by the time we set \u2014 by the time we bought the spots for the Super Bowl and things like that it was basically in the bag. It\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t work twenty four hours a day for the last six months to get it out but we were on the bomb run at that time.\nInterviewer:\nI love this, I don\u2019t want to call it \u2014 this thing that you did was just have everybody sign the cases, that was great. Why did you do that?\nSJ:\nBecause the people that worked on it consider themselves and I certainly consider them artists. These are the people that under different circumstances would be painters and poets but because of that time that we live in this new medium has appeared in which to express oneself to one\u2019s fellow species and that\u2019s a medium of computing. And so a lot of people that would have been artists and scientists have gone into this field to express their feeling and so it seemed like the right thing to do.\nInterviewer:\nWhat was it like when you announced at the shareholders meeting?\nSJ:\nOh wow it was \u2013 well I got the first few rows had all the people that worked on the Mac. About a hundred people. A hundred fifty people that really made it happen were all seated in the first few rows and when it was introduced, after we went through it all and had the computer speak to people itself and things like that, the whole auditorium of that twenty five hundred people gave it a standing ovation and the whole first few rows of Mac folks were all just crying. All of us were just \u2026. I was biting my tongue very hard because I had a little bit more to do. But it was a very very emotional moment because it was no longer ours. From that day forward it was no longer ours. We couldn\u2019t change it. If we had a good idea the following day it was too late. It belonged to the world at that point in time.\n\nI should probably get going.\nInterviewer:\nYeah, I am just thinking a couple. But let\u2019s do the kickers then. Okay, these are the 15 seconds, the beginning of the show to grab people\u2019s attention. So program three, we\u2019re going from semiconductors to the growth and the establishment of the computer industry. So what did you accomplish? What did you set out to do and what did you do?\nSJ:\nWell I think maybe it\u2019s something different along the lines of what you want to say\u2026.. . You know the semiconductor people didn\u2019t know what they had in the micro-processor for two to three years. It was the computer hobbies that really got the idea to make this into a computer rather than a calculator.\nInterviewer:\nWould you like to build a company or change the world?\nSJ:\nWhen we started Apple we were out to build computers for our friends. That was all, no idea of a company.\nInterviewer:\nHow important is a user interface in the design of a computer?\nSJ:\nWell, the whole idea of the Macintosh was a computer for people who want to use a computer rather than learn how to use a computer.\nInterviewer:\nOne way we\u2019ve been playing with it is it\u2019s not how it does it but what it does. In other words I don\u2019t care how it does it anymore, I just want it to do what I want it to do.\nSJ:\nRight. There is a quote in interview that was done with me in Playboy a while ago. I gave a Macintosh to a young kid one time. It was actually Sean Lennon at his birthday. And he had a great quote, he said, everyone else \u2013 and I guess I said this actually \u2014\nInterviewer:\nI think this is the older people and the younger people.\nSJ:\nYeah, right, the older people all want to know how it does what it does but the young people just want to know what it can do.\nInterviewer:\nOkay, wrap that up in two \u2013the graphical interface, the trend, the line that we\u2019re going, how about this \u2013 where are we in the evolution of the user interface? And where are we going?\nSJ:\nThe whole discussion about user interface is just strange to me because to me it\u2019s just sort of a natural thing that had to happen and did happen and it\u2019s happened. It\u2019s kind of like automatic transmissions. Not quite the same as that but\u2026\nInterviewer:\nOkay, networking. Why is networking important? Why is it the future?\nSJ:\nWell in the nineties we\u2019re going revolutionize human to human communication using these desktop computers in the same way that spreadsheets revolutionized financial modeling and the desktop publishing revolutionized publishing.\nInterviewer:\nGreat.\nSJ:\nOkay, good.\nInterviewer:\nAnything we haven\u2019t covered?\nSJ:\nNo, I got to go.\nInterviewer:\nThis is great.

      "question": "\nWhat happens when you have a network that allows the relative minorities in a whole different area come together. How does that change the democracy?",
      "answer": "\nI don\u2019t know. But what I have seen is I\u2019ve seen interpersonal computing happening at our own company. Or maybe the best way to put it is, I remember when the first spreadsheet came out. I saw it fly through Apple as well as other companies. And when we invented desktop publishing of course it influenced Apple first. And I\u2019ve seen the same thing happen with interpersonal computing here at NeXT. We decided to put a NeXT machine on every employee\u2019s desktop about 18 months ago and connect them with the very high-speed networking that\u2019s built in. And I\u2019ve seen the revolution here with my own eyes. And it\u2019s actually larger than the first two. Let me give you some examples.\n\nIf we want to \u2014 if we\u2019re going to be doing a special project let\u2019s say with a company, and we \u2014 and let\u2019s say the company is called, what\u2019s your\u2026WGBH. We\u2019re going to be doing a special project with WGBH. And what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll create a special mailbox, WGBH and we\u2019ll put twenty people on it that are going to be helping on this project. Now these twenty people will be from all over our company, from marketing, from sales, from engineering, some from manufacturing. Maybe some from our Boston office so they can be close by. And if one sends a message to this mailbox, they\u2019ll all get it like that, instantly. And if one sends a reply they\u2019ll copy the whole mailbox so the rest of the team members get to read the intellectual content going back and forth. And everyone on this, in this mailbox will probably get around 30 mail messages a day. And they\u2019ll spend about twenty minutes, thirty minutes reading these and answering these per day. And it will be like a beehive.\n\nNow this project is very important for our company and I want to make sure it\u2019s getting off right. So I\u2019ll put my own name on this mailbox and I\u2019ll see these thirty mail messages fly by. All of the disagreements and the arguments and the thoughts and the decisions. And I can just let it fly by and read it. I can do some background coaching with a few people if I think they\u2019re a little off track. I can get right on the network and kibbutz if I\u2019d like. And after a month or so when I know that it\u2019s going well I can take my name off. And so not only is this a way to organize violating all management and geographic boundaries, it\u2019s also a way to manage where one can see. Again the thoughts, disagreements and decisions of a company fly by a manager in a way that they never could before. And we have seen it reduce the number of meetings we have at least by fifty percent. We\u2019ve seen it get far more managers and individual contributors involved in decisions than there ever were before. We think the quality of the decisions is a lot higher. And we\u2019ve seen a window for management to look into the process of this organism we call our company in a way that has never before been possible. As we become part of this electronically community that\u2019s going to provide us wonderful new capabilities and communications abilities. But we still always want to be able to disconnect that network spigot, take it off, and take our standalone computer somewhere, let\u2019s say home.\n\nNow what\u2019s going to happen rapidly as with radio links and with fiber optics to the home, you\u2019re going to be able to hook your computer up to your network at home. But there\u2019s always going to be that cabin in the middle of nowhere that I want to go for a two week vacation where I want my computer. And if it doesn\u2019t work in a completely standalone way, I\u2019m going to be not happy. So we have to provide a fluid way for these things to kind of dock into the mother load network, but also undock and allow me as an individual to carry my computer up into Yosemite backpacking. And where there\u2019s no radio links and no fiber optic links and still be able to use it and then come back and dock back into the network and find out what happened when I left and share some of my thoughts maybe with some other folks. So we\u2019re working on that. That\u2019s our goal for the next five years is that seamless transition between a standalone computer and the computer as part of this network community."

      "question": "\nI want to get your thoughts on the user interface stuff. And I\u2019d like to look at the transition \u2013 Xerox to Apple. When did you hear, what was the image of Xerox PARC and what was it like when you first went in there?",
      "answer": "\nWell Xerox PARC was a research lab set up by Xerox when they were making a lot of profits in copier days. And they were doing some computer science research which was basically an extension of some stuff started by a guy named Doug Engelbart when he was at SRI. Doug had invented the mouse, and invented the Bitmap display. And some Xerox folks that\u2026that Xerox I believe hired away from Doug or split off from Doug somehow and got to Xerox, were continuing along in this vein. And I first went over there in 1979 and I saw what they were doing with the larger screens, proportionately spaced texts and the mouse. And it was just instantly obvious to anyone that this was the way things should be. And so I remember coming back to Apple thinking our\u2026our future has just changed. This is where we have to go.\n\nThe problem was that Xerox had never made a commercial computer. This group of people at Xerox was\u2026was was more concerned with looking out fifteen years than they were looking out fifteen months trying to make a product that somebody could use. So there were a lot of issues that they hadn\u2019t solved like menus, other things like that. And at Apple what we had to do was to do two things. One was complete the research which really was only about fifty percent complete. And the second was to find a way to implement it at a low enough cost where people would buy it. And that was really our challenge."

      "question": "\nWhat did you succeed in doing with the Mac?",
      "answer": "\nWell the Macintosh as you remember when it came out, we called it the computer for the rest of us. And what that meant was that while experts could use some of the computers that were already out, most people didn\u2019t 4want \u2014 again the computer was not an end in itself. It was a means to an end. And so most people didn\u2019t want to learn how to use the computer. They just wanted to use it. And the Macintosh was supposed to be the computer for people that just wanted to use a computer without having to learn how to use one, spend six months.\n\nNow it turned out that the paradox was that to make a computer easier to use you needed a more powerful computer in the first place because you were going to burn a lot of the cycles on making it easy to use. And so this computer that was easy to use was actually more powerful and could do more things than the less easy to use computer. And it took people a few years to figure that out about the Macintosh. But I think people did."

      "answer": "\nDisk drive was crucial. One of the things that people forget when they think about\u2026about Apple and the Apple II in particular was that we were the first company to come out with a reliable, inexpensive floppy disk drive. And we had a low cost floppy disk drive that really worked about two to three years before any of our competitors. And that was an incredibly important reason why the Apple II was successful. A matter of fact, there were a few others. The Apple II could hold up to 48 kilobytes of memory which today doesn\u2019t seem like much, but at that time was maybe three times as much as its competitors. And that\u2019s why Visicalc was written for the Apple II. It was the only computer that could hold it.

      "question": "\nOne of the theses is that\u2026. well let me turn this question around. How important is market research? How much did you rely on it in the early days?",
      "answer": "\nWell I think in the early days it was very easy because you would go to a home group computer club meeting and there was your whole market and so you could find out what they thought. Now if you show them your product and see what they thought and you could because products were much simpler then and within a few months you could change it all around and come back and show the new one.\n\nBut as the market got more sophisticated it was less easy to do that. And the problem is that market research can tell you what your customers think of something you show them. Or it can tell you what your customers want as an incremental improvement on what you have but very rarely can your customers predict something that they don\u2019t even quite know they want yet. As an example no market research could have led to the development of the Macintosh or the personal computer in the first place. So there are these sort of non-incremental jumps that need to take place where it\u2019s very difficult for market research to really contribute much in the early phases of thinking about how to \u2014 you know what those should be. However once you have made that jump possibly before the products on the market or even after is a great time to go check your instincts with the marketplace and verify that you\u2019re on the right track. And usually when you show people something they\u2019ll say oh my God this is fantastic. Or give you some feedback along those lines."

      "answer": "\nOne could go on for a long time about how the US has forgotten about manufacturing which has certainly been true but we\u2019re starting to wake up. And what we\u2019re finding is is that time to market is very important and quality is very important and the way we can make tremendous increase in quality and reductions in time to market is through automation. So the automation isn\u2019t there to lower the cost although it does do that, it\u2019s really there to increase the quality and decrease the time it takes us to get our new product, as an example, to market which is very important in a technology based marketplace.\n\nSo we happen to be the lowest cost producer in the world already at NeXT of our class of products. We also happen to be one of the highest quality producers of our type of product in the world. And we think for a company to survive much less prosper in the nineties that these are going to be very very important things to be world class at. We\u2019re not competing at the home group computer society anymore, we\u2019re competing with Europe Inc. and Japan Inc. and IBM Inc. and in order to do that we really have to be world class manufacturers."

      "answer": "\nWell education been on computer networks for longer than almost anyone else. The Department of Defense has an office called DARPA and they funded a thing called ah ARPANET many many years ago to try to build a command and control network for military purposes. And they did a very brilliant thing. After they got a prototype working they gave it to the university community in America and said bang on this for awhile and see if it works and help us make it better. And after a few years of the university community doing that they created a separate version for military purposes but they left the educational version going. And that is tied together the research community of the United States now for about a decade. And it\u2019s vital to the functioning of higher education in this country.\n\nSo higher education has actually led the way. That\u2019s why we started off focusing exclusively on higher education because where else could you find five thousand people on a network but Carnegie Mellon University as an example. So higher education has been five years ahead of business in using computers in some of these powerful new ways which we\u2019re going to see now ripple into business in the first half of the nineties.

When we were building our Apple Is in the garage, we knew exactly what they cost. When we got into a factory in the Apple II days, the accounting had this notion of a standard cost, where you'd kind of set a standard cost, and then at the end of a quarter, you'd adjust it with a variance. And I kept asking, well, why do we do this? And the answer was well, that's just the way it's done. And after about six months of digging into this, what I realized was the reason you do it, is because you don't really have good enough controls to know how much it costs. So you guess, and then you fix your guess at the end of the quarter. And the reason you don't know how much it cost is because your information systems aren't good enough. So, but nobody said it that way.

I mean, you know, there are just certain things you can't make electrons do, there are certain things you can't make plastic do or glass do. And, as you get into - or factories do, or robots do. And as you get into all of these things, designing a product is keeping 5,000 things in your brain, these concepts, and fitting them all together in kind of, continuing to push, to fit them together in new and different ways to get what you want. And every day you discover something new that is a new problem or a new opportunity to fit these things together a little differently. And it's that process that is the magic."

      "answer": "Haha. No, that's not usually what I meant. I - you know, when you get really good people, they know they're really good, and you don't have to baby people's ego so much. And what really matters is the work. And everybody knows that, that's all that matters, is the work. So, it - people are being counted on to do specific pieces of the puzzle. And the most important thing I think you can do for somebody who's really good, and who's really being counted on, is to point out to them when they're not - their work isn't good enough. And to do it very clearly, and to articulate why and to get them back on track. And you need to do that in a way that does not call into question your confidence in their abilities, but leaves not too much room for interpretation that their work, the work that they've done for this particular thing is not good enough to support the goal of the team. And that's a hard thing to do. And I've always taken a very direct approach. So and I think if you talk to people that have worked with me, the really good people have found it beneficial.

And we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.

But if it hadn't been for computer science, these people would have all been, you know, doing amazing things in life and other fields.

A very, very liberal arts attitude, that we wanted to pull in the best that we saw in these other fields into this field. And I don't think you get that if you are very narrow."

He joined the coast guard in World War II and ferried troops around the world for General Patton; and I think he was always getting into trouble and getting busted down to Private. He was a machinist by trade and worked very hard and was kind of a genius with his hands. He had a workbench out in his garage where, when I was about five or six, he sectioned off a little piece of it and said \"Steve, this is your workbench now.\" And he gave me some of his smaller tools and showed me how to use a hammer and saw and how to build things. It really was very good for me. He spent a lot of time with me . . . teaching me how to build things, how to take things apart, put things back together.\n\nOne of the things that he touched upon was electronics. He did not have a deep understanding of electronics himself but he'd encountered electronics a lot in automobiles and other things he would fix. He showed me the rudiments of electronics and I got very interested in that. I grew up in Silicon Valley. My parents moved from San Francisco to Mountain View when I was five. My dad got transferred and that was right in the heart of Silicon Valley so there were engineers all around. Silicon Valley for the most part at that time was still orchards--apricot orchards and prune orchards--and it was really paradise.

I wanted to read books because I loved reading books and I wanted to go outside and chase butterflies. You know, do the things that five year olds like to do. I encountered authority of a different kind than I had ever encountered before, and I did not like it. And they really almost got me. They came close to really beating any curiosity out of me. By the time I was in third grade, I had a good buddy of mine, Rick Farentino, and the only way we had fun was to create mischief. I remember we traded everybody. There was a big bike rack where everybody put their bikes, maybe a hundred bikes in this rack, and we traded everybody our lock combinations for theirs on an individual basis and then went out one day and put everybody's lock on everybody else's bike and it took them until about ten o'clock that night to get all the bikes sorted out. We set off explosives in teacher's desks. We got kicked out of school a lot. In fourth grade I encountered one of the other saints of my life. They were going to put Rick Farentino and I into the same fourth grade class, and the principal said at the last minute \"No, bad idea. Separate them.\" So this teacher, Mrs. Hill, said \"I'll take one of them.\" She taught the advanced fourth grade class and thank God I was the random one that got put in the class. She watched me for about two weeks and then approached me. She said \"Steven, I'll tell you what. I'll make you a deal. I have this math workbook and if you take it home and finish on your own without any help and you bring it back to me, if you get it 80% right, I will give you five dollars and one of these really big suckers she bought and she held it out in front of me. One of these giant things. And I looked at her like \"Are you crazy lady\"? Nobody's ever done this before and of course I did it. She basically bribed me back into learning with candy and money and what was really remarkable was before very long I had such a respect for her that it sort of re-ignited my desire to learn. She got me kits for making cameras. I ground my own lens and made a camera. It was really quite wonderful. I think I probably learned more academically in that one year than I learned in my life. It created problems though because when I got out of fourth grade they tested me and they decided to put me in high school and my parents said \"No.\". Thank God. They said \"He can skip one grade but that's all.\""

      "question": "\nI've got a couple of questions I'd like to ask you about specifically about your experience at Apple. Looking back at the years you were there, what were the accomplishments you are most proud of? Are there a couple of Apple stories you really like to tell?",
      "answer": "\nApple was this incredible journey. I mean we did some amazing things there. The thing that bound us together at Apple was the ability to make things that were going to change the world. That was very important. We were all pretty young. The average age in the company was mid-to-late twenties. Hardly anybody had families at the beginning and we all worked like maniacs and the greatest joy was that we felt we were fashioning collective works of art much like twentieth century physics. Something important that would last, that people contributed to and then could give to more people; the amplification factor was very large.\nIn doing the Macintosh, for example, there was a core group of less than a hundred people, and yet Apple shipped over ten million of them. Of course everybody's copied it and it's hundreds of millions now. That's pretty large amplification, a million to one. It's not often in your life that you get that opportunity to amplify your values a hundred to one, let alone a million to one. That's really what we were doing. If you look at what we tried to do, it was to say \"Computation and how it relates to people is really in its infancy here. We are in the right place at the right time to change the course of that vector a little bit.\" What's interesting is that if you change the course of a vector near its origin, by time it gets a few miles out its course is radically different. We were very cognizant of this fact. From almost the beginning at Apple we were, for some incredibly lucky reason, fortunate enough to be at the right place at the right time. The contributions we tried to make embodied values not only of technical excellence and innovation--which I think we did our share of--but innovation of a more humanistic kind.\n\nThe things I'm most proud about at Apple is where the technical and the humanistic came together, as it did in publishing for example. The Macintosh basically revolutionized publishing and printing. The typographic artistry coupled with the technical understanding and excellence to implement that electronically--those two things came together and empowered people to use the computer without having to understand arcane computer commands. It was the combination of those two things that I'm the most proud of. It happened on the Apple II and it happened on the Lisa, although there were other problems with the Lisa that caused it to be a market failure; and then it happened again big time on the Macintosh."

  [
    {
      "question": "\nAnd the artistry is in the elegance of the solution, like chess playing or mathematics?",
      "answer": "\nNo. I think the artistry is in having an insight into what one sees around them. Generally putting things together in a way no one else has before and finding a way to express that to other people who don't have that insight so they can get some of the advantage of that insight that makes them feel a certain way or allows them to do a certain thing. I think that a lot of the folks on the Macintosh team were capable of doing that and did exactly that. If you study these people a little bit more what you'll find is that in this particular time, in the 70's and the 80's the best people in computers would have normally been poets and writers and musicians. Almost all of them were musicians. Alot of them were poets on the side. They went into computers because it was so compelling. It was fresh and new. It was a new medium of expression for their creative talents. The feelings and the passion that people put into it were completely indistinguishable from a poet or a painter. Many of the people were introspective, inward people who expressed how they felt about other people or the rest of humanity in general into their work, work that other people would use. People put a lot of love into these products, and a lot of expression of their appreciation came to these things. It's hard to explain."

      "question": "\nApple had a reputation as a company that absolutely broke the mold and set its own course. Looking back from where you are today with NeXT, do you think that, as Apple grew larger, it could have sustained that original approach? Or was it destined to become a big standard American company?",
      "answer": "\nThat's a funny question. Apple did grow big and sustain that approach. When I left Apple it was a two billion dollar company. We were Fortune 300 and something. We were 350. When the Mac was introduced we were a billion dollar corporation; so Apple grew from nothing to two billion dollars while I was there. That's a pretty high growth rate. It grew five times since I left basically on the back of the Macintosh. I think what's happened since I left in terms of growth rate has been trivial compared with what it was like when I was there. What ruined Apple wasn't growth. What ruined Apple was values. John Sculley ruined Apple and he ruined it by bringing a set of values to the top of Apple which were corrupt and corrupted some of the top people who were there, drove out some of the ones who were not corruptible, and brought in more corrupt ones and paid themselves collectively tens of millions of dollars and cared more about their own glory and wealth than they did about what built Apple in the first place--which was making great computers for people to use.\nThey didn't care about that anymore. They didn't have a clue about how to do it and they didn't take any time to find out because that's not what they cared about. They cared about making a lot of money so they had this wonderful thing that a lot of brilliant people made called the Macintosh and they got very greedy and instead of following the original trajectory of the original vision--which was to make this thing an appliance, to get this out there to as many people as possible--they went for profits and they made outlandish profits for about four years. Apple was one of the most profitable companies in America for about four years.\n\nWhat that cost them was the future. What they should have been doing was making reasonable profits and going for market share, which was what we always tried to do. Macintosh would have had a thirty- three percent market share right now, maybe even higher, maybe it would have even been Microsoft but we'll never know. Now its got a single digit market share and falling. There's no way to ever get that moment in time back. The Macintosh will die in another few years and its really sad. The problem is this: no one at Apple has a clue as to how to create the next Macintosh because no one running any part of Apple was there when the Macintosh was made--or any other product at Apple. They've just been living off that one thing now for over a decade and the last attempt was the Newton and you know what happened to that. It's kind of tragic, but as unemotionally as I can be, that's what's happening. Unless somebody pulls a rabbit out of a hat, companies tend to have long glide slopes because of the installed bases. But Apple is just gliding down this slope and they're loosing market share every year. Things start to spiral down once you get under a certain threshold. And when developers no longer write applications for your computer, that's when it really starts to fall apart."

      "question": "\nIs there a user of Apple or a story that you could tell that in your mind exemplifies what the company stood for and its values at its best? What customers were using the Apple when you were there?",
      "answer": "\nThere were two kinds of customers. There were the educational aspects of Apple and then there were sort of the non-educational. On the non-educational side, Apple was two things. One, it was the first \"lifestyle\" computer and, secondly, it's hard to remember how bad it was in the early 1980's. With IBM taking over the world with the PC, with DOS out there; it was far worse than the Apple II. They tried to copy the Apple II and they had done a pretty bad job. You needed to know a lot. Things were kind of slipping backwards. You saw the 1984 commercial. Macintosh was basically this relatively small company in Cupertino, California, taking on the goliath, IBM, and saying \"Wait a minute, your way is wrong. This is not the way we want computers to go. This is not the legacy we want to leave. This is not what we want our kids to be learning. This is wrong and we are going to show you the right way to do it and here it is. It's called Macintosh and it is so much better. It's going to beat you and you're going to do it.\"\nAnd that's what Apple stood for. That was one of the things. The other thing was a little bit further back in time. One of the things that built Apple II's was schools buying Apple II's; but even so there was about only 10% of the schools that even had one computer in them in 1979 I think it was. When I grew up I was lucky because I was in Silicon Valley. When I was ten or eleven I saw my first computer. It was down at NASA Ames (Research Center). I didn't see the computer, I saw a terminal and it was theoretically a computer on the other end of the wire. I fell in love with it. I saw my first desktop computer at Hewlett-Packard which was called the 9100A. It was the first desktop in the world. It ran BASIC and APL I think. I fell in love with it. And I thought, looking at these statistics in 1979, I thought if there was just one computer in every school, some of the kids would find it. It will change their life.\n\nWe saw the rate at which this was happening and the rate at which the school bureaucracies were deciding to buy a computer for the school and it was real slow. We realized that a whole generation of kids was going to go through the school before they even got their first computer so we thought the kids can't wait. We wanted to donate a computer to every school in America. It turns out that there are about a hundred thousand schools in America, about ten thousand high schools, about ninety thousand K through 8. We couldn't afford that as a company. But we studied the law and it turned out that there was a law already on the books, a national law that said that if you donated a piece of scientific instrumentation or computer to a university for educational and research purposes you can take an extra tax deduction. That basically means you don't make any money, you loose some but you don't loose too much. You loose about ten percent. We thought that if we could apply that law, enhance it a little bit to extend it down to Kthrough 8 and remove the research requirements so it was just educational, then we could give a hundred thousand computers away, one to each school in America and it would cost our company ten million dollars which was a lot of money to us at that time but it was less than a hundred million dollars if we didn't have that. We decided that we were willing to do that.\n\nIt was one of the most incredible things I've ever done. We found our local representative, Pete Stark over in East Bay and Pete and a few of us sat down an we wrote a bill. We literally drafted a bill to make these changes. We said \"If this law changes we will donate a hundred thousand computers at a cost of ten million dollars to us.\" We called it \"the kids can't wait bill\". Pete Stark introduced it in the House and Senator Danforth introduced it in the Senate and I refused to hire any lobbyists and I went back to Washington myself and I actually walked the halls of Congress for about two weeks, which was the most incredible thing. I met probably two-thirds of the House and over half of the Senate myself and sat down and talked with them.\n\nIt was very interesting. I found that the House Members are routinely less intelligent than the Senate and they were much more kneejerk to their constituencies--which I found initially quite offensive but came to understand later to be a really good idea. Maybe that's what the framers wanted. They weren't supposed to think too much, they were supposed to represent. The Senators are supposed to think a little more. The Bill passed the House with the largest favorable majority of any tax bill in the history of this country. What happened was it was in during Carter's lame duck session and Bob Dole who was then Speaker of the House killed it. He would not bring it to the floor and we ran out of time. We would have had to have started the process over in the next year and I gave up.\n\nHowever, fortunately something unique happened. California thought this was such a good idea they came to us and said \"You don't have to do a thing. We're going to pass a bill that says 'Since you operate in the State of California and pay California Tax, we're going to pass this bill that says that if the federal bill doesn't pass, then you get the tax break in California'. You can do it in California, which is ten thousand schools\". So we did. We gave away ten thousand computers in the State of California. We got a whole bunch of the software companies to give away software. We trained teachers for free and monitored this thing over the next few years. It was phenomenal. One of my great experiences and one of my biggest regrets was that really tried to do this on a national level and got so close. I don't think Bob Dole even knew what he was doing but he really unfortunately screwed up here."

      "question": "\nNeXT Software: what makes it different? What trends does it respond to?",
      "answer": "\nThat's the real gem. I'll tell you an interesting story. When I was at Apple, a few of my acquaintances said \"You really need to go over to Xerox PARC (which was Palo Alto Research Center) and see what they've got going over there.\" They didn't usually let too many people in but I was able to get in there and see what they were doing. I saw their early computer called the Alto which was a phenomenal computer and they actually showed me three things there that they had working in 1976. I saw them in 1979. Things that took really until a few years ago for us to fully recreate, for the industry to fully recreate in this case with NeXTStep. However, I didn't see all three of those things. I only saw the first one which was so incredible to me that it saturated me. It blinded me to see the other two. It took me years to recreate them and rediscover them and incorporate them back into the model but they were very far ahead in their thinking. They didn't have it totally right, but they had the germ of the idea of all three things. And the three things were graphical user interfaces, object oriented computing and networking.\nLet me go through those. Graphical interface: The Alto had the world's first graphical user interface. It had windows. It had a crude menu system. It had crude panels and stuff. It didn't work right but it basically was all there. Objects: They had Smalltalk running, which was really the first object-oriented language. Simula was really the first but Smalltalk was the first official object oriented language. Third, networking: They invented Ethernet there, as you know. And they had about two hundred Altos with servers hooked up in a local area network there doing e-mail and everything else over the network, all in 1979. I was so blown away with the potential of the germ of that graphical user interface that I saw that I didn't even assimilate or even stick around to investigate fully the other two.\n\nNeXTStep turned some of that vision into reality. It incorporated the world's first truly commercial object oriented system, and really was the most networked system in the world when it came out. I think the world has made a lot of progress in networking but hasn't yet crossed the hurdle into objects and what's happened with NeXTStep. It's starting to get adopted by some very large corporate customers. It is now the most popular object oriented system in the world, as objects are on the threshold of starting to move into the mainstream. The company last year recorded its first profit in its nine year history, and sold fifty million dollars worth of software. I think we're going to have some significant growth this year and it's fairly clear that NeXT can get up to being a few hundred million dollar software company in the next three or four years and be the largest company offering objects until Microsoft comes into the market at some point, probably with a pretty half-baked product."

So I actually think this is a pretty typical case where California is again on the leading edge not only in a technical but cultural shift. So I do expect the Web to be a worldwide phenomenon, distributed fairly broadly.

      "question": "\nIt sounds really exciting. The question I was going to ask--and you've partially answered it--was about start-up companies. As I look around the facility here and your literature, there are alliances written all over the walls literally. You're aligned with Hewlett-Packard, Sun, Oracle and Digital and all the systems integrators. Communications companies and information technology companies are merging. And becoming one. Do you think it will ever be possible for a new major start-up company to develop if they're going to focus on major applications or software? Will there ever be another?",
      "answer": "\nI think yes. One might sometimes say in despair no, but I think yes. And the reason is because human minds settle into fixed ways of looking at the world and that's always been true and it's probably always going to be true. I've always felt that death is the greatest invention of life. I'm sure that life evolved without death at first and found that without death, life didn't work very well because it didn't make room for the young. It didn't know how the world was fifty years ago. It didn't know how the world was twenty years ago. It saw it as it is today, without any preconceptions, and dreamed how it could be based on that. We're not satisfied based on the accomplishment of the last thirty years. We're dissatisfied because the current state didn't live up to their ideals. Without death there would be very little progress.\nOne of the things that happens in organizations as well as with people is that they settle into ways of looking at the world and become satisfied with things and the world changes and keeps evolving and new potential arises but these people who are settled in don't see it. That's what gives start-up companies their greatest advantage. The sedentary point of view is that of most large companies. In addition to that, large companies do not usually have efficient communication paths from the people closest to some of these changes at the bottom of the company to the top of the company which are the people making the big decisions. There may be people at lower levels of the company that see these changes coming but by the time the word ripples up to the highest levels where they can do something about it, it sometimes takes ten years. Even in the case where part of the company does the right thing at the lower levels, usually the upper levels screw it up somehow. I mean IBM and the personal computer business is a good example of that. I think as long as humans don't solve this human nature trait of sort of settling into a world view after a while, there will always be opportunity for young companies, young people to innovate.

And I go \"Oh that's great, what's your idea?\". And they say \"I don't have one yet\". And I say \"I think you should go get a job as a busboy or something until you find something you're really passionate about because it's a lot of work\". I'm convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance. It is so hard. You put so much of your life into this thing. There are such rough moments in time that I think most people give up. I don't blame them. Its really tough and it consumes your life. If you've got a family and you're in the early days of a company, I can't imagine how one could do it. I'm sure its been done but its rough. Its pretty much an eighteen hour day job, seven days a week for awhile. Unless you have a lot of passion about this, you're not going to survive. You're going to give it up. So you've got to have an idea, or a problem or a wrong that you want to right that you're passionate about otherwise you're not going to have the perseverance to stick it through.

      "question": "\nYou need passion to build a company like Apple or IBM or any other major company. Once you've taken the passion to that level and built a company and are in the position like a Bill Gates at Microsoft or anybody else, yourself, what are the responsibilities of those who have succeeded and have economic power, social power? I mean, you've changed the world. What are your responsibilities within that?",
      "answer": "\nThat question can be taken on many levels. Obviously if you're running a company you have responsibilities but as an individual I don't think you have responsibilities. I think the work speaks for itself. I don't think that people have special responsibilities just because they've done something that other people like or don't like. I think the work speaks for itself. I think people could choose to do things if they want to but we're all going to be dead soon, that's my point of view. Somebody once told me, they said \"Live each day as if it would be your last and one day you'll certainly be right.\" I do that. You never know when you're going to go but you are going to go pretty soon. If you're going to leave anything behind its going to be your kids, a few friends and your work. So that's what I tend to worry about. I don't tend to think about responsibility. A matter of fact I tend to like to on occasion pretend I don't have any responsibilities. I try to remember the last day when I didn't have anything to do and didn't have anything to do the following day that I had to do and I had no responsibilities. It was decades ago. I pretend when I want to feel that way. I don't think in those terms. I think you have a responsibility to do really good stuff and get it out there for people to use and let them build on the shoulders of it and keep making better stuff."

When you think of the innovation that's come out of this area, Silicon Valley and the whole San Francisco Berkeley Bay area, you've got the invention of the integrated circuit, the invention of the microprocessor, the invention of semi-conductor memory, the invention of the modern hard disk drive, the invention of the modern floppy disk drive, the invention of the personal computer, invention of genetic engineering, the invention of object oriented technology, the invention of graphical user interfaces at PARC, followed by Apple, the invention of networking.

      "question": "Apple certainly has a tradition of introducing technologies that becom standards. But lately Apple seems more apologetic about being different than it is proud about being different. And as a developer, you start to feel that way. And I just wonder, 13 years after introducing the Macintosh, what happened, what else to do to get balls back?",
      "answer": "Yeah, I gotta tell you, I have a little different point of view on that. I think Apple's had its head in the sand for the last many years.  (coughs)  Excuse me. There is - there has been so much that's happened in terms of network computing, as an example, that Apple has completely missed out on. The Mac is probably one of the least networked computer communities in the world, in terms of really making use of powerful networks. I mean, like, when NeXT joined Apple, right? NeXT has an extremely sophisticated network infrastructure for doing network computing, compared to Apple. And, you know, even now, we struggle getting the Apple folks to understand it, because the Mac has been, because of all this proprietariness in every way, because of the attitude of arrogance that we can not only invent our own networking, but invent our own this and invent our own that, and invent our own this and... it's in its own little world, and the rest of the world, with so much investments, passed it by. And so we need to bring the Mac up into the modern world in many areas, like network computing, and to do that because we weren't first, because we didn't set the standards and they've already been cast in stone, we're going to have to use them. So I think the wisdom here is not to say that we've got to invent everything ourselves. The wisdom here is to know what 10% or 20% or 30% probably at most of the stuff we have to do invent, and what we should go use that exists?"

The day we started Apple Computer, IBM was far more powerful in the computer industry than Microsoft and Intel are today, the day we started Apple. Because they not only controlled the technologies,  they controlled the customer. They had direct contact with the customer. And so we should have just given up. I mean, and Woz was, you know I should've just nudged Woz, Hey, forget it. We don't have a chance. But, we were too stupid to know that. We hadn't gone to business school.

And so, fortunately we've been fighting that fight for a long, long time with our notebooks, right? With our Macs. And so, we've got a lot of technology for managing power. I think Macs are pretty well known for managing power quite a bit, you know, kind of the best of breed in the PC industry. And, we've applied a lot of that and learned a lot more from iPods.

      "question": "Dave Jaworski, with PassAlong networks, and we have about 2 million songs in MP3 format today that we use to power FYE, Sam Goody, and other brands. And, when we have the EMI catalog, it will be MP3. You talk about interoperability and how DRM free opens that up, but your DRM free is AAC. So if I have a Sony reader that has, that plays MP3 files, I can play any song I buy in MP3 format, or that I rip from CDs. If I have my Garmin GPS, it will play MP3 files. But if I buy DRM free from iTunes, I have to go through a transcoding process and the consumer doesn't really understand transcoding or else they have to rip it and burn it, in which case they're no better off than they were with buying a DRM file and they lose all the metadata, the artist's name, the track name. Why not make Apple's DRM free mean MP3, and get rid of the confusion that is being created for the consumer?",
      "answer": "Well the answer, first of all, let me point out a few things. Let me point out a few things. Number one, of course all the MP3s that you guys sell will play just fine on iPods. And number two, the reason we chose AAC in the first place is, for a given data rate, it's significantly superior to MP3 in its audio quality. So it's a much better encoder. And we don't own it. We license it. Anyone can go license it, and as a matter of fact, a bunch of people have. Microsoft has, most of the players out there have gone and licensed AAC and they do play AAC. So, I'm sure you can name a list of people that don't, but they can easily go out and license it and they'll play it. But most of the big players out there now do play AAC. Cause it a. It is a superior codec and b. they want to be able to play stuff that iTunes people rip their CDs in iTunes, and they, most of them choose to rip it into AAC, they want to be able to play that stuff.

And in the consumer market, at least I think one can make a pretty strong case that outside of Windows on PCs, it's hard to see other examples of the software and hardware being decoupled, working super well yet. It might in the phone space over time. It might. But it's not clear. It's not clear. You can see a lot more examples of the hardware, software coupling working well.
