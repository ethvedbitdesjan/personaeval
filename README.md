# Steve Jobs Style Emulation Project

## 1. Methodology

### 1.1 Data Collection
- **Dataset Creation**: Compiled Q&A pairs from Steve Jobs interview transcripts
- **Selection Criteria**:
  - Minimum response length: 100 characters
  - Focus on direct question-answer exchanges
  - Context-independent responses only
- **Dataset Size**: 50 Q&A pairs (40 training, 10 test)
  **Note**: There was manual cleaup for qa pairs after get_interviews.ipynb was run. Please see useful_qa_pairs1.json.

### 1.2 Model Selection
- **Primary Model**: Gemini-Flash for Steve Jobs emulation
- **Evaluation Model**: Claude Haiku for style assessment

### 1.3 Evaluation Framework
Our evaluation system combines three complementary metrics:

1. **Semantic Similarity (35%)**
   - Sentence embedding comparison
   - Word Mover's Distance analysis
   - Focus on content and meaning alignment

2. **Linguistic Feature Analysis (35%)**
   - POS distribution matching
   - Dependency pattern comparison
   - Structural similarity assessment

3. **LLM Style Evaluation (30%)**
   - Comprehensive analysis of:
     - Narrative techniques and anecdote usage
     - Characteristic language patterns
     - Response structure
     - Content relevance

## 2. Prompt Optimization System

### 2.1 System Architecture
The `PromptOptimizer` class implements an iterative optimization pipeline with the following key components:

```python
class PromptOptimizer:
    # Core Methods
    - analyze_weak_points()      # Performance analysis
    - get_improvement_suggestions() # Prompt enhancement
    - evaluate_prompt_version()  # Version testing
    - optimize_prompt()          # Iteration control
    - final_evaluation()         # Results validation
```

### 2.2 Optimization Process
1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Baseline prompt evaluation
   - Performance metric establishment
   - Reference point creation

2. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Multiple optimization cycles
   - Validation subset testing
   - Continuous performance monitoring

3. **Final Testing**
   - Hold-out test set evaluation

## 3. Results and Analysis

### 3.1 Performance Metrics
#### Run 1
- Training Set (n=40):
  - Baseline: 0.648 → Optimized: 0.666
  - 72.5% samples improved (29/40)
- Test Set (n=10):
  - Baseline: 0.619 → Optimized: 0.669
  - 70% samples improved (7/10)

#### Run 2
- Training Set (n=40):
  - Baseline: 0.646 → Optimized: 0.660
  - 67.5% samples improved (27/40)
- Test Set (n=10):
  - Baseline: 0.629 → Optimized: 0.651
  - 70% samples improved (7/10)

#### Manual Optimization
Fine-tuning the optimized prompt by hand gave an additional 0.01-0.02 improvement in evaluation scores in one of the runs.

### 3.2 Key Improvements
1. **Linguistic Authenticity**
   - Enhanced pattern matching (e.g., characteristic word usage)
   - Improved rhetorical structure
   - Better pacing and emphasis

2. **Content Quality**
   - Stronger personal perspective integration
   - More effective use of rhetorical devices
   - Better technology-human experience connection

### 3.3 Areas for Improvement
- Over-formality in presentation-style responses
- Occasional verbosity compared to authentic responses
- Inconsistent use of emphasis markers

## 4. Implementation Insights

### 4.1 Prompt Development
- Evolution from basic to sophisticated prompts
- Enhanced emotional content integration
- Improved balance of technical and visionary elements

### 4.2 Response Characteristics
- Optimal length: 100-150 words
- Most effective elements:
  - Clear personal conviction
  - Technical precision
  - Emotional resonance
  - Vision articulation

## 5. Future Development

### 5.1 Metric Enhancements
- Rhetorical device detection implementation
- Knowledge graph integration for belief consistency
- Context-aware evaluation system

### 5.2 System Improvements
- Extended context window for evaluation
- Multi-turn conversation support
- LLM feedback integration
- RAG implementation for belief consistency

## 6. Implementation Guide

```python
# System Setup
optimizer = PromptOptimizer(base_prompt, qa_results, eval_results)

# Run Optimization
optimization_results = optimizer.optimize_prompt(
    num_iterations=2,
    test_size=5,
    improvement_threshold=0.05
)

# Evaluate Results
final_results = optimizer.final_evaluation(optimization_results['best_prompt'])
```

## 7. Project Timeline
